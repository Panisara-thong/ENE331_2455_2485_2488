# ENE 331 LAB CHALLENGE
The ENE331 Lab Challenge is an experiment involving the use of the STM32 Microcontroller, focusing on system clock configuration, LED control, user input handling, and timer usage. All tasks are accomplished through register-level programming to control various functions, such as blinking an LED at a specific interval, generating accurate timing signals, and verifying the results using an oscilloscope to ensure correct operation.
